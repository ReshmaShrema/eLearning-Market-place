const app = express();
create an express and let put it in a variable,if we execute the express function ,then that will availabel in the app variable
middleware ,some code which will run before any response is sent back to our client.before the response is sent in between ,as soon as we get the request we might need to do some work so that time we can execute the middleware function
anytime we want to apply middleware ,we will use the 'use' funtion that is availabel with express
app.use(cors());
this will allow to pass json data
app.use(express.json());
app.get('/,()=>{})
when we get request to the endpoint '/' we want to sent some response,the get method have two parameter 
express is a request response handler
app.use() requires a middleware function
app.use(console.log('this is my own middleware'));
